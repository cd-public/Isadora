1st set of 106 regs (M_AXI_<reg>'s):
Trace generation:  4:38:xx
Mining src->sink:  0:83:xx

2nd set of 125 regs (the not M_AXI):
Trace generation:  4:55:xx
Mining src->sink:  0:83:xx

Mining ran concurrently with trace generation.

Notes on characterizing a design:

1st set:

36 No flows, 61 flows, 105 total

Common cases are:

1. (43) Flow within X, X_wire, X_INT
2. (04) Above plus 'reg03_r_anomaly', 'reg05_w_anomaly', 'reg_data_out'
3. (21) First flow to A<R/W>_ADDR_VALID

3. has the flow condition similarities as previously described.
1. and 2. usually have similar mass profiles with the iflow in initialization / after each reset.

Both sets:

55 No flows, 174 flows, 229 total

1. (43) Flow within X, X_wire, X_INT
2. (04) Above plus 'reg03_r_anomaly', 'reg05_w_anomaly', 'reg_data_out'
3. (109) First flow to A<R/W>_ADDR_VALID

Most others are somewhat novel, sometimes in groups of similar destinations up to size ~10. There's some grouping around "regs" and "S_AXIs"

There are 12840 total source=?=>sinks. 6298 (49%) are in 3., from 109 sources to 158 unique sinks. The most sinks from a single source is 131.
